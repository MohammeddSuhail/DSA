DFS in Binary Trees: pre, in, post

BFS in Binary Trees: Level Order Traversal




In BST for every node,
every val on left < node.val  and every val right is > node.val

In-order of BST is always sorted



If pre-order and post-order are given,
you can't construct a binary unique tree


Can construct a binary unique tree,
if in-order and pre-order is given
if in-order and post-order is given
